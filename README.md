# Why Does the Xiang River Flow to North?  
An Interactive Visualization of World Cultural Heritage

**Live Demo**: https://why-xiang-river-go-north2-git-main-xuans-projects-fd9a3c06.vercel.app/
## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web application that visualizes over 1,200 UNESCO World Heritage sites as a flowing golden particle river, inspired by the poetic question "Why Does the Xiang River Flow North?".  My project is a modern React + Vite application, so it cannot be viewed correctly by simply double-clicking index.html (styles and interactions would be missing).
Key features:
- Three.js-powered particle system where each meaningful particle represents a real heritage site
- Click on a particle to open a detailed heritage card with description, interactive map, related poetry, and regional sites
- AI Creative Studio: Use Google Gemini to reimagine heritage sites with custom artistic prompts(haven't finish it yet)
- Bilingual support (English / Chinese)
- Elegant gold-and-black aesthetic with classical typography
